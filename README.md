### Commit Message Convention

The project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation update
- `style`: Formatting changes that don't affect code logic
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `chore`: Build tasks, package manager configs, etc.

**Examples:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add user login functionality"
git commit -m "fix(api): resolve user data fetching issue"
git commit -m "docs: update installation guide"
git commit -m "style(client): format code with prettier"
```

### Hooks

The project has built-in git hooks to ensure code quality:

- **pre-commit**: Run lint and format code
- **commit-msg**: Check commit message format

### Branch Naming

- `main`: Production branch
- `feature/feature-name`: For new features
- `bugfix/bug-description`: For bug fixes
- `hotfix/issue-description`: For urgent production issues

### Standard Workflow

1. **Create a new branch**
   Always branch off from the latest version of `main`.

   ```bash
   git checkout Frontend
   git pull origin Frontend
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Work on your feature**
   Make your code changes and commit them using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(auth): add login functionality"
   ```

3. **Rebase with the latest main branch**
   Before pushing, make sure your branch is up to date with `main`:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/Frontend
   ```

4. **Push your branch to remote**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**
   Open a PR to merge your branch into `Frontend` using the project’s PR template.
   Wait for review and approval before merging.

6. **After Merge — Sync and Clean Up**
   Once your PR is merged:

   ```bash
   git checkout Frontend
   git pull origin Frontend
   git branch -d feature/your-feature-name     # delete local branch
   git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name   # delete remote branch
   ```
